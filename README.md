# rush-hour
The rush-hour-solver/ directory contains a pom.xml file that should provide all needed information for Maven to build the project. As in the assignments, the performance tests can be run with "mvn exec:java" and the unit tests can be run with "mvn test". It is important to note that Maven cannot build this project unless you are in rush-hour-solver/ or one of its subdirectories, not the main directory. All puzzles used for the performance tests are encoded in puzzles.txt, located in rush-hour-solver/src/main/resources/. The encoding is simple (each car's x-position, y-position, length, and whether it's horizontal separated by commas, with line breaks separating each car and a blank line separating each board). If you would like, you can add additional tests and you will see the change reflected in the performance test output.
